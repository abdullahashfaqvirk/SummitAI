Participants:
Abdullah Ashfaq (Team Lead)
Zubair (React Developer)
Etisam (Django Developer)

Key Updates:
Zubair: Completed the sidebar component for the dashboard, integrated with React Router, and set up state logic using Zustand. Working on the theme switcher and debugging a hydration mismatch error in the notification panel.
Etisam: Finalized user authentication APIs with JWT-based login, registration, and email verification. Implemented rate limiting on the login endpoint. Facing CORS issues while integrating the AI model endpoint.

Next Steps:
Zubair: Finalize the notification panel, add Discord alert UI toggle, fix hydration error, and start styling AI summary cards if time permits.
Etisam: Resolve CORS issue, finalize AI summarization API, add logging to backend tasks, and integrate the file system tool with the summary queue if possible.

Decisions:
The bot name is finalized as "IntelBrief."
For the MVP, AI summaries will be processed immediately on upload.
Discord alerts will include a high-level title, short summary, file name, and a link to the full report.

Action Items:
Ensure all work is committed cleanly before lunch for merging into the staging branch.
Retry logic for failed summaries will be handled manually for now.
